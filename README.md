The samples, data acquisition and data reduction processes are described
in detail therein.

This folder contains the following data files:

- Au144PET_100K_APS.chi
- Au144PET_100K_APS.gr
- Au144SC4_100K_APS.chi
- Au144SC4_100K_APS.gr
- Au144SC6_100K_APS.chi
- Au144SC6_100K_APS.gr
- Au144SC12_100K_APS.chi
- Au144SC12_100K_APS.gr
- Kapton_APS.chi
- Au144pMBA_100K_ESRF.chi
- Au144pMBA_100K_ESRF.gr

These datasets were measured from 5 different samples Au144(PET)60,
Au144(SC4)60, Au144(SC6)60, Au144(SC12)60 and Au144(pMBA)60, as stated in the
file names.  All scattering data were measured at 100 K.  The first 4 datasets
were obtained at the 11-ID-B beamline of the Advanced Photon Source (APS),
with a wavelength of 0.143 Å.  The data are provided in plain text format
as integrated total scattering intensities versus Q [1/nm] in .chi files and
as reduced pair distribution functions (PDF-s) in .gr files.  The data in
Kapton_APS.chi are background scattering intensities to be used with the APS
data.  The last dataset, Au144pMBA_100K_ESRF, was obtained at the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) beamline ID11 using X-ray wavelength of
0.177 Å.  Here, the background has already been subtracted.

Columbia University for any questions regarding the data and their use.
